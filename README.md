# Internet-Banking-System_BA

Project Objective
To upgrade the current internet banking system by improving user experience, strengthening security features, and incorporating advanced capabilities such as biometric authentication and real-time notifications.

Business Problem
Customers are experiencing slow transaction times, limited mobile functionality and concerns over security vulnerabilities with the current internet banking system.

AS-IS State
The current system supports basic transactions, account management, and periodic updates via email or SMS. It lacks features like biometric security, advanced analytics for users, and seamless mobile support.

To-BE State
The upgraded system will provide:
Real-time processing of transactions
Full mobile functionality with native app support
Biometric login and transaction authorization
Personalized financial insights through advanced analytics
Integration with other financial platforms and services
